Project Overview

This is a small frontend test project built using React + Vite + TypeScript.

While the requirements could be fulfilled using vanilla JavaScript, I intentionally chose a modern React-based setup to better demonstrate real-world development practices, scalability, and maintainability that are typically expected in production applications.

Why Not Vanilla JS?

The same functionality can absolutely be implemented using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
However, in professional environments:

Projects tend to grow over time

Codebases are maintained by multiple developers

Reusability, structure, and consistency become critical

Using React and supporting libraries reflects how I would approach the same problem in a real production scenario.

Libraries Used & Rationale

React – Component-based structure for clarity and reusability

TypeScript – Type safety and better developer experience

styled-components – Scoped, maintainable styling aligned with component architecture

framer-motion – Declarative animations commonly used in modern UIs

These tools are not strictly required for a small task, but they demonstrate practical decision-making and familiarity with commonly used frontend tooling.

Scripts
npm run dev       # Start development server
npm run build     # Build for production
npm run preview   # Preview production build
npm run lint      # Run ESLint
npm run start     # Build and serve production build

Final Note

The goal of this setup is not over-engineering, but to show how I translate simple requirements into a clean, scalable solution, similar to how I would approach tasks in a real-world team environment.
